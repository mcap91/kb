# Claude Operating Guide

<!-- BEGIN kb-managed -->
Managed by kb — edits inside this block are overwritten by `kb bootstrap` / `kb sync-contract`; edit outside the markers.

## kb integration

This repository uses the `kb` toolkit (repo-local wiki, reviewed dispatch, deterministic graph). The kb
MCP servers (`kb-wiki`, `kb-dispatch`) are registered in this repo's `.mcp.json` and run from the kb
checkout; every kb tool call targets this repository via `dir`.

### Retrieval — do this before substantive work

Repository-context retrieval is a wiki/docs retrieval problem first, not a filesystem-search problem first.

1. Search the wiki with the kb wiki MCP `search` tool. This is the first retrieval step.
2. If you need a structured overview, regenerate views with the MCP `generate` tool and read them
   (`catalog`, `now`, `inbox`, `backlog`, `archive`).
3. Then read the relevant durable `docs/` pages.
4. Then check related `wiki/decisions/`, `wiki/issues/`, `wiki/initiatives/`, `wiki/areas/`, `wiki/sources/`.
5. Only then inspect implementation files.

If the kb wiki MCP server is not available this session, run the same steps via the kb CLI from the kb
checkout (`npm run wiki -- search --dir <this repo>`, `npm run wiki -- generate --dir <this repo>`). Do
not use raw `rg`, file globbing, or direct file reads as the first retrieval step — use the wiki MCP tools
(`search`, `generate`, `lint`), or the CLI fallback, first. Do not parallelize implementation search with
the initial retrieval pass.

### Operating rules

- Wiki: prefer the `kb-wiki` MCP tools (`search`, `generate`, `lint`, `create`, `allocate-id`,
  `build-search-index`, `sync-contract`, `bootstrap`); CLI fallback `npm run wiki -- … --dir <this repo>`.
- Dispatch: prefer the `kb-dispatch` MCP tools or the kb CLI.
- Graph: kb CLI (`npm run graph -- --dir <this repo>`).
- Always pass `dir` pointing at this repository; run kb from its own checkout, not this repo root.
- Do not create `HO-*` via `wiki create` — handoffs are dispatch-owned under `wiki/handoffs/`.
- If wiki records and code/tests disagree, report the mismatch rather than trusting a grep-first conclusion.

This file is the compatibility entrypoint for Claude Code sessions. The full agent operating guide is in `AGENTS.md` -- read that first.

## Quick Reference

### Validation (run before declaring any work complete)

```
npm run typecheck && npm test
```

### Key Commands

```
npm run wiki -- <command> --dir <path>     Wiki operations
npm run dispatch -- <command>              Dispatch operations
npm run graph -- --dir <path>              Graph extraction
npm test                                   All tests
npm run typecheck                          Type checking
```

### Key Invariants

- `HO-*` is dispatch-owned, not a wiki record type. `wiki create` rejects `HO`.
- `wiki/handoffs/` is excluded from lint, generate, search, and graph.
- Graph is deterministic and file/module level only. No semantic inference.
- All public functions return Result types. Do not throw.
- Agent processes spawn with `cwd = agent-visible` inside the reviewed run bundle. The agent never controls its working directory.
- Import `@kb/wiki-core` from wiki-cli and wiki-mcp. Import `@kb/dispatch-core` from dispatch-cli. No cross-subsystem imports.

### Monorepo Structure

Six packages under `packages/`: `wiki-core`, `wiki-cli`, `wiki-mcp`, `dispatch-core`, `dispatch-cli`, `graph-explore`.

Contract lives in `contract/` with `manifest.json` as the source of truth for record types.

### Subagents

Subagents default to Sonnet via `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` in `.claude/settings.json`. Pass `model: "opus"` on individual Agent calls only when the subagent needs complex reasoning or a Sonnet attempt produced inadequate results.

### Do Not

- Modify files under `scratch_space/`
- Add HO to the manifest
- Include `wiki/handoffs/` in wiki scanning operations
- Add semantic/heuristic graph features
- Throw from public API functions
- Import across subsystem boundaries
